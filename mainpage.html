               <h3>cctv, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
               <p>The digital video combines my own recorded video as well as my own recorded sound. Driving down the freeway in the evening often puts me into a daze as I see the sun setting. The ticking represents the feeling of the drive being soporific and dull. </p>
